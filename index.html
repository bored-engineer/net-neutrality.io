						<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
						<p>My name is [Your Name], and I am writing to comment on the FCC's recent proposed changes to net neutrality.</p>
						<p>Allowing a 'fast lane' in which companies would be allowed to charge for faster internet is not a good idea. It's burning the candle at both ends; just about every ISP already charges their customers very high rates for mediocre service. Charging companies for providing data as well is short-sighted and indefensible.</p>
						<p>It would also seriously harm competition and innovation by raising the barrier to entry for new companies. New streaming video sites would become exceedingly difficult to start, for example, because they would not have the wherewithal to pay ISPs for faster speeds that established corporations enjoy.</p>
						<p>Further, this would hurt consumers. We already don't have much choice as to which ISP we use. With fast lanes, we would be stuck with poor service if we did not use an ISP that companies opted to pay. So not only will new internet companies be hurt by the policy, new and small ISPs could also be severely impacted because no company will pay for faster speeds in just a few counties.</p>
						<p>Really, allowing a 'fast lane' would benefit large internet service providers while hurting everybody else. Forget net neutrality, that's not neutrality.
						As a consumer, I urge the FCC to classify ISPs as common carriers. But failing that, at least refrain from implementing this disastrous policy.</p>
						<p>Thank you very much for your time,</p>
						<p>[Your Name]</p>
