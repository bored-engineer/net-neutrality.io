			<h1>Demand Real Net Neutrality!</h1>
			<p>The FCC has proposed new rules that threaten your freedom online. These rules would allow telecommunication giants like Comcast and AT&amp;T to decide what you can and can't do online. Internet Providers will be able to restrict free speech and stifle innovation. Scroll down to learn more about the dangers of these rules.</p>

		<h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
		<p class="lead">Net neutrality is the idea that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. A nice way to understand net neutrality is to think of the Internet like you think of electricity, you pay for a certain amount and when it arrives at your home you can use it as you wish. The electricity company doesn't get to decide to dim your lightbulbs for you and then offer new 'brighter' bulbs that are just the same light bulbs you had before. And that's how the Internet should be too. Net neutrality simply says that all traffic should be treated equally regardless of whether it's traffic from Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, or any other site. If you wish to learn more, please watch this video explanation:</p>

		</div>
		<h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
		<p class="lead">Net neutrality isn't just something that should only matter to nerds, it's something that impacts everyone who uses the Internet, including you. If net neutrality is gone, your Internet provider could restrict what websites you can visit based purely on the fact they don't like them, or you. The new rules suggusted by the FCC threaten to let cable and phone companies create an Internet fast lane for big corporations and a slow lane for everyone else, like you and me. Unless you do something about it, this little nightmare is going to happen, the process has already started.</p>
		<h2>What can I do?</h2>
		<p class="lead">Currently, the FCC has proposed a new set of rules regarding net neutrality that are anything but neutral. The rules allow ISPs (like Comcast, TWC, AT&amp;T, etc.) to discriminate against any traffic they don't like by slowing it down, even to the point where sites don't work at all. You can tell the FCC and your representatives that they need to fix these rules by reclassifying ISPs as <i>Title II Common Carriers</i> where they would be required to act as data carriers and avoid altering the flow of information in any manner.</p>

					<p class="lead">The FCC has asked for comments from the general public about the proposed rules to be sent to <b>openinternet@fcc.gov</b>.</p>
					<p class="lead">We've provided a sample template for an email below, feel free to use it and modify it as you like.</p>
					<div class="well">
						<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
						<p>My name is [Your Name], and I am writing to comment on the FCC's recent proposed changes to Net Neutrality.</p>
						<p>Allowing Internet Service Providers to give preferential treatment to content providers is contrary to the concept of Net Neutrality. Fundamentally, the word preferential is the opposite of neutral. Any inclusion of restrictions or requirements of "commercially reasonable" terms does not change this fact.</p>
						<p>It would be detrimental to competition and innovation by raising the barrier to entry for content providers. New companies would become exceedingly difficult to start because they would not have the wherewithal to pay Internet Service Providers for faster speeds that established companies employ.</p>
						<p>If the FCC is truly supportive of Net Neutrality, I urge them to reclassify all Internet Service Providers as Title II Common Carriers as laid out in the Telecommunications Act of 1934. From my understanding, this will force all Internet Service Providers to act as data carriers and restrict them from altering the flow of information in any manner.</p>
						<p>I do NOT support allowing Internet Service Providers to give preferential treatment to content providers. Please refrain from implementing this policy.</p>
						<p>I ask that the FCC reclassify Internet Service Providers as Title II Common Carriers.</p>
						<p>Thank you very much for your time,</p>
