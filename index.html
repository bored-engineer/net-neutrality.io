			<h1>Demand Real Net Neutrality!</h1>
			<p>The FCC has proposed new rules that threaten your freedom online. These rules would allow telecommunication giants like Comcast and AT&amp;T to decide what you can and can't do online. Internet Providers will be able to restrict free speech and stifle innovation. Scroll down to learn more about the dangers of these rules.</p>

						<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
						<p>My name is [Your Name], and I am writing to comment on the FCC's recent proposed changes to Net Neutrality.</p>
						<p>Allowing Internet Service Providers to give preferential treatment to content providers is contrary to the concept of Net Neutrality. Fundamentally, the word preferential is the opposite of neutral. Any inclusion of restrictions or requirements of "commercially reasonable" terms does not change this fact.</p>
						<p>It would be detrimental to competition and innovation by raising the barrier to entry for content providers. New companies would become exceedingly difficult to start because they would not have the wherewithal to pay Internet Service Providers for faster speeds that established companies employ.</p>
						<p>If the FCC is truly supportive of Net Neutrality, I urge them to reclassify all Internet Service Providers as Title II Common Carriers as laid out in the Telecommunications Act of 1934. From my understanding, this will force all Internet Service Providers to act as data carriers and restrict them from altering the flow of information in any manner.</p>
						<p>I do NOT support allowing Internet Service Providers to give preferential treatment to content providers. Please refrain from implementing this policy.</p>
						<p>I ask that the FCC reclassify Internet Service Providers as Title II Common Carriers.</p>
						<p>Thank you very much for your time,</p>
						<p>[Your Name]</p>
